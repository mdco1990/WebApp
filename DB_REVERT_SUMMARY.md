# Database Revert Summary

## What Was Reverted

### 1. PostgreSQL Migration System
- ❌ Removed `migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` (PostgreSQL-specific schema)
- ❌ Removed `migrations/` directory
- ❌ Removed `docker-compose.db.yml` (PostgreSQL + Redis setup)

### 2. MySQL Support
- ❌ Removed `internal/db/mysql_init/` directory
- ❌ Removed MySQL driver import from `internal/db/db.go`
- ❌ Removed MySQL connection logic and retry mechanisms
- ❌ Removed `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` dependency

### 3. Complex Database Configuration
- ❌ Removed `DBDSN` field from config
- ❌ Removed multi-driver support (only SQLite remains)
- ❌ Simplified database connection logic

## What Was Kept

### 1. SQLite Development Environment
- ✅ SQLite database driver (`github.com/glebarez/sqlite`)
- ✅ SQLite schema in `internal/db/schema.sql`
- ✅ SQLite-compatible table structure
- ✅ Automatic schema migration on startup

### 2. Development Configuration
- ✅ Development environment settings (`ENV=dev`)
- ✅ Local file-based database (`./data/app.db`)
- ✅ CORS configuration for local development
- ✅ Debug logging configuration

### 3. Core Application Features
- ✅ User authentication system
- ✅ Income and budget management
- ✅ Expense tracking
- ✅ Manual budget functionality
- ✅ Session management

## Current Database Setup

### SQLite Configuration
```env
DB_DRIVER=sqlite
DB_PATH=./data/app.db
```

### Database Location
- **Path**: `./data/app.db`
- **Type**: SQLite file database
- **Schema**: Embedded in application
- **Migrations**: Automatic on startup

### Benefits of Current Setup
1. **No External Dependencies**: SQLite is file-based
2. **Simple Development**: No need for Docker containers
3. **Fast Startup**: No connection delays
4. **Easy Backup**: Just copy the `.db` file
5. **Portable**: Database travels with the application

## How to Use

### 1. Start Development
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start the application
go run ./cmd/webapp
```

### 2. Database File
- The SQLite database will be created automatically at `./data/app.db`
- The schema will be applied automatically on first startup
- No manual migration steps required

### 3. Development Workflow
- Make changes to the schema in `internal/db/schema.sql`
- Restart the application to apply changes
- The database file persists between restarts

## Future Considerations

If you need to add PostgreSQL or MySQL support later:

1. **Re-add the migration system** with proper driver support
2. **Restore the docker-compose.db.yml** for production-like environments
3. **Add back the multi-driver configuration** in the config system
4. **Implement proper migration versioning** for production deployments

For now, the SQLite setup provides a clean, simple development environment that's easy to work with and doesn't require external services.

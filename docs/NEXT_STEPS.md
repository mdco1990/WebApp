- Ensure all patterns work together seamlessly

### 2. Performance Benchmarking
- Test the event-driven architecture under load
- Measure concurrent operation performance improvements
- Validate real-time event processing latency
- Compare before/after performance metrics
- Establish baseline performance standards

### 3. Documentation & API Documentation
- Update API documentation with new event-driven endpoints
- Create architecture diagrams showing the event flow
- Document the new patterns and how to use them

- **API Gateway**: Implement centralized API management

## ðŸ›  Development Environment Setup (Priority 3)

### 8. Developer Experience Improvements
- Set up hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- Create development scripts for easy testing
- Set up linting and code formatting
- Configure IDE extensions for better development
- Create development environment documentation

### 9. Testing Infrastructure
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Add performance testing suites
- Implement contract testing for API changes
- Set up automated security scanning
- Create testing documentation and guidelines

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended Priority Order
